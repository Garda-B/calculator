## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

Many calculators are built using the eval() function or the Function constructor. As this is not considered best practice, I created mine with a totally original logic. It's by far not perfect and rather rudimentary, but it works.  

### Built with

- React.JS

## Acknowledgments

I used this guy's tutorial for the themes:
